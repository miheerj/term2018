Choosing the Best cereal among the 80 cereal brands in USA
If you like to eat cereal and pay attention to the nutrition facts, you probably already have been misled. The nutrition displayed on the cereal boxes is measured by serving, which is not a standardized unit. Each manufacturer has its own definition of serving. Further, the same manufacturer can have different definition of serving for different cereals. Therefore, a serving can mean different volume or weight depending on manufacturers and the type of cereal. They are not directly comparable. This makes nutrition facts on cereal boxes hard to understand, and ever misleading.
